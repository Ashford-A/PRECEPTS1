# Characterizing subgroupings in an AML single-cell RNAseq cohort #

In this experiment, we train mutation classifiers to predict the presence
of mutation subgroupings in the beatAML cohort before applying them to a novel
cohort of scRNA samples.


## Preparing to run the experiment ##

After cloning the `dryads-research` repository and installing the `research`
conda environment, make sure you have the following environment variables
defined in your bash environment:

 - *$CODEDIR* where the `dryads-research` repo was checked out
 - *$TEMPDIR* a temporary location for intermediate experiment output files
 - *$DATADIR* a permanent location for the final experiment output files

 - move data_locs to experiments.utilites
 - move data_dirs to experiments.AML_scRNA_analysis
 - set up synapse
 - get permissions for beatAML Synapse repos
 - make sure conda is added to $PATH
