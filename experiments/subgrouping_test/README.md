# Testing the classification performance of oncogene mutation subgroupings #

In this experiment we train mutation classifiers to predict the presence of
subsets of genes' mutations in a tumor cohort. The characteristics of these
subgrouping classification models and especially their performances can then
be used to make inferences about the heterogeneity of downstream effects
caused by the mutations of a given cancer gene.


## Preparing to run the experiment ##

Clone the `dryads-research` git repository into the current directory:

```git clone https://github.com/ohsu-comp-bio/dryads-research.git```

Install the `research` conda environment:

```conda env create -f environment.yml```
