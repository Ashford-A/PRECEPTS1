This experiment tests the expression signature similarity of mutually exclusive
mutations.

In a cohort of tumour samples, we can identify mutations that co-occur in the
same samples significantly less often than expected given their individual
rates of occurence. These pairs of mutations can be assumed to be disrupting
the same pathways or processes that are associated with tumourgenesis; thus
only mutation in each pair needs to be present for successful tumour,
putting negative selection for the other mutation to occur concurrently. We
would therefore expect that such mutations would share similar expression
signatures, corresponding to the downstream disruption they had in common.
